### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

<ins>This was my first time learning web exploits. I learned fundamentals concepts related to this field, just as how vulnerable websites are exploited using injection and php code. I also learned HTML and CSS are susceptible to inspection allowing bypassers to look up to your source code and view hidden details or even files. Additionally, XSS and SQLi are new terms I leanred related in attacking. After that, I was able to find my first flag froma challenge in the web exploit category in picoCTF. </ins>


**What challenged you?**

<ins>At first I was just blankly staring at the website, didn't know what to do. However, I read different writeups about it and I was able to crack the challenge and find the flag. (It was a challenged about modifying or altering headers in requests protocols of a website)</ins>

**Key learning:**

<ins>Source Code Inspection, Checking dev tools, Translating hidden ecrypted texts using rot13 or base64</ins>

**Tomorrow's focus:**

<ins>More CTF challenges and new techniques.</ins>
