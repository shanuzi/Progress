### 5. Reflection (Qualitative)

**What went well today?**

<ins>I learned new techniques such as the XFF or X-Forwarded-For, which is a header that functions as a retriever for the real IP address of the requester rather than the proxy server. This technique intrigued me because of its power in bypassing rate-limiting or attempt-limited websites.</ins>


**What challenged you?**

<ins>I first found it tough to solve Crack the Gate 2 in picoCTF, which highlights the use of XFF. I was having a hard time coming up with a solution, but in the end I opt to look up of online resources related to the challenge</ins>

**Key learning:**

<ins>Able to learn new techniques, such as editing the URL to access hidden files, e.g., robots.txt.
I was also able to learn a little bit of git.</ins>

**Tomorrow's focus:**

<ins>More CTF challenges and new techniques.</ins>
